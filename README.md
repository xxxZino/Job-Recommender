## üìñ Description
This project is the implementation of my undergraduate thesis titled  
**‚ÄúJob Candidate Recommendation System using Sentence-BERT and Cosine Similarity.‚Äù**

The goal is to help companies select the most suitable candidates for job vacancies based on **skill matching**.

The following methods are compared:
- **TF-IDF** ‚Üí frequency-based word representation
- **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** ‚Üí semantic embeddings representation
- **Hybrid (TF-IDF + SBERT)** ‚Üí a combination of both

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Upload candidate & job vacancy datasets (CSV)  
- Text preprocessing (case folding, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
- Similarity calculation with Cosine Similarity  
- Recommendation methods: **TF-IDF**, **SBERT**, and **Hybrid**  
- Candidate ranking based on similarity scores  
- Result visualization (method comparison charts, candidate ranking tables)
